## About

The purpose of this project is to help a company answer some questions they have about their employees. We are able to  answer these questions by summarizing their lengthy employee data using SQL queries. The data is modeled in different views to capture different bits of information. Being able to group the data and order the results can help us to draw conclusions in a clear, organized way to help the coompany.
This gives us practice in the thought process before diving into a project and understanding the relationship between the different pieces of information provided to you for your analysis and practice with writing the actual queries for the analysis.
